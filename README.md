# CARD-SHUFFLING-AND-SORTING-GAME
The project was to sort a deck of cards, which should be shuffled in random manner and split into 4 groups that is suits(Spade, Heart, Club, Diamond.).And sort the cards first by suit and internally in each suit further sort the cards by number and prints them separately.

Used OS concepts like Multithreading, Process control system calls 
and developed a better card shuffling and sorting algorithm.
